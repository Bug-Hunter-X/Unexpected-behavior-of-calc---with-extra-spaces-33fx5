The solution is simple: Remove the extra spaces around the operators within the `calc()` function.  Ensure there are no spaces before or after the `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/` operators. 

For instance, the following corrected code should be used: 

```css
width: calc(100% - 10px);
```

By removing the extra spaces, the `calc()` function will parse the expression correctly, producing the desired outcome.
